# fly-7-Resolve
This project was organized when I was doing the ship model. At that time, the control board I used was the arduino uno r3 Bluetooth control. Since the controllable range of Bluetooth was small and it was easy to lose, I would like to use a receiver that can fly 7 to the world. To solve the remote control range. The remote control signal PPM reads the value through UNO's analog port and converts the value into a PWN signal using a small algorithm. As for the determination of the range of this value, it is to find a predecessor on the Internet to do a project related to the analysis of the world's 7 receivers. (Some code ideas draw on the network)
