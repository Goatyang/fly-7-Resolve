# fly-7-Resolve
This project was organized when I was doing the ship model. At that time, the control board I used was the arduino uno r3 Bluetooth control. Since the controllable range of Bluetooth was small and it was easy to lose, I would like to use a receiver that can fly 7 to the world. To solve the remote control range. The remote control signal PPM reads the value through UNO's analog port and converts the value into a PWN signal using a small algorithm. As for the determination of the range of this value, it is to find a predecessor on the Internet to do a project related to the analysis of the world's 7 receivers. (Some code ideas draw on the network)//这个项目是我在做船模的时候整理的，当时我用的控制板是arduino uno r3的蓝牙控制，由于蓝牙的可控制范围较小，容易丢失，我就想办法用天地飞7的接收机来解决遥控范围。就是将遥控信号PPM通过UNO的模拟口读取值，将值转换成PWN信号，中间用了一个小算法。至于这个值的范围确定是通过在网上找到前辈做过一个相关的解析天地飞7的接收机的项目。（有些代码的思想借鉴网络）
